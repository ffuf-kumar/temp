    "description": "<strong>RESTful API for Account Information Services (AIS) and Payment Initiation Services (PIS)</strong>\n\nThe following pages give you some general information on how to use our APIs.<br/>\nThe actual API services documentation then follows further below. You can use the menu to jump between API sections.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis page has a built-in HTTP(S) client, so you can test the services directly from within this page,\nby filling in the request parameters and/or body in the respective services, and then hitting the TRY button.\nNote that you need to be authorized to make a successful API call. To authorize, refer to the 'Authorization'\nsection of the API, or just use the OAUTH button that can be found near the TRY button.\n<br/>\n\n<h2 id=\"general-information\">General information</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"general-error-responses\"><strong>Error Responses</strong></h3>\nWhen an API call returns with an error, then in general it has the structure shown in the following example:\n\n<pre>\n{\n  \"errors\": [\n    {\n      \"message\": \"Interface 'FINTS_SERVER' is not supported for this operation.\",\n      \"code\": \"BAD_REQUEST\",\n      \"type\": \"TECHNICAL\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"date\": \"2020-11-19 16:54:06.854\",\n  \"requestId\": \"selfgen-312042e7-df55-47e4-bffd-956a68ef37b5\",\n  \"endpoint\": \"POST /api/v1/bankConnections/import\",\n  \"authContext\": \"1/21\",\n  \"bank\": \"DEMO0002 - finAPI Test Redirect Bank\"\n}\n</pre>\n\nIf an API call requires an additional authentication by the user, HTTP code 510 is returned and the error response\ncontains the additional \"multiStepAuthentication\" object, see the following example:\n\n<pre>\n{\n  \"errors\": [\n    {\n      \"message\": \"Es ist eine zusätzliche Authentifizierung erforderlich. Bitte geben Sie folgenden Code an: 123456\",\n      \"code\": \"ADDITIONAL_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED\",\n      \"type\": \"BUSINESS\",\n      \"multiStepAuthentication\": {\n        \"hash\": \"678b13f4be9ed7d981a840af8131223a\",\n        \"status\": \"CHALLENGE_RESPONSE_REQUIRED\",\n        \"challengeMessage\": \"Es ist eine zusätzliche Authentifizierung erforderlich.

Further entries must be fetched with\nsubsequent calls.\n<br/><br/>\nAny API service that implements paging provides the following input parameters:<br/>\n&bull; \"page\": the number of the page to be retrieved (starting with 1).<br/>\n&bull; \"perPage\": the number of entries within a page. The default and maximum value is stated\nin the documentation of the respective services.\n\nA paged response contains an additional \"paging\" object with the following structure:\n\n<pre>\n{\n  ...\n  ,\n  \"paging\": {\n    \"page\": 1,\n    \"perPage\": 20,\n    \"pageCount\": 234,\n    \"totalCount\": 4662\n  }\n}\n</pre>\n\n<h3 id=\"general-internationalization\"><strong>Internationalization</strong></h3>\nThe finAPI services support internationalization which means you can define the language you prefer\nfor API service responses.\n<br/><br/>\nThe following languages are available: German, English, Czech, Slovak.\n<br/><br/>\nThe preferred language can be defined by providing the official HTTP <strong>Accept-Language</strong>\nheader.\n<br/><br/>\nfinAPI reacts on the official iso language codes &quot;de&quot;, &quot;en&quot;, &quot;cs&quot;\nand &quot;sk&quot; for the named languages.\nAdditional subtags supported by the Accept-Language header may be provided,\ne.g. &quot;en-US&quot;, but are ignored.\n<br/>\nIf no Accept-Language header is given, German is used as the default language.\n<br/><br/>\nExceptions:<br/>\n&bull; Bank login hints and login fields are only available in the language of the bank and not\nbeing translated.<br/>\n&bull; Direct messages from the bank systems typically returned as BUSINESS errors will not\nbe translated.<br/>\n&bull; BUSINESS errors created by finAPI directly are available in German and English.<br/>\n&bull; TECHNICAL errors messages meant for developers are mostly in English, but also may be\ntranslated.\n\n<h3 id=\"general-request-ids\"><strong>Request IDs</strong></h3>\nWith any API call, you can pass a request ID via a header with name \"X-Request-Id\".\nThe request ID can be an arbitrary string with up to 255 characters.\nPassing a longer string will result in an error.\n<br/><br/>\nIf you don't pass a request ID for a call, finAPI will generate a random ID internally.\n<br/><br/>\nThe request ID is always returned back in the response of a service, as a header with\nname \"X-Request-Id\".\n<br/><br/>\nWe highly recommend to always pass a (preferably unique) request ID, and include it into your\nclient application logs whenever you make a request or receive a response\n(especially in the case of an error response). finAPI is also logging request IDs on its end.\nHaving a request ID can help the finAPI support team to work more efficiently and solve tickets faster.\n\n<h3 id=\"general-overriding-http-methods\"><strong>Overriding HTTP methods</strong></h3>\nSome HTTP clients do not support the HTTP methods PATCH or DELETE.\nIf you are using such a client in your application, you can use a POST request instead with a special\nHTTP header indicating the originally intended HTTP method.\n<br/><br/>\nThe header's name is <strong>X-HTTP-Method-Override</strong>. Set its value to either\n<strong>PATCH</strong> or <strong>DELETE</strong>.\nPOST Requests having this header set will be treated either as PATCH or DELETE by the finAPI servers.\n<br/><br/>\nExample:\n<br/><br/>\n<strong>X-HTTP-Method-Override: PATCH</strong><br/>\nPOST /api/v1/label/51<br/>\n{\"name\": \"changed label\"}<br/><br/>\nwill be interpreted by finAPI as:<br/><br/>\nPATCH /api/v1/label/51<br/>\n{\"name\": \"changed label\"}<br/>\n\n<h3 id=\"general-user-metadata\"><strong>User metadata</strong></h3>\nWith the migration to PSD2 APIs, a new term called \"User metadata\"\n(also known as \"PSU metadata\") has been introduced to the API.\nThis user metadata aims to inform the banking API if there was a real end-user\nbehind an HTTP request or if the request was triggered by a system\n(e.g. by an automatic batch update). In the latter case, the bank may apply some restrictions\nsuch as limiting the number of HTTP requests for a single consent.\nAlso, some operations may be forbidden entirely by the banking API.\nFor example, some banks do not allow issuing a new consent without the end-user being involved.\nTherefore, it is certainly necessary and obligatory for the customer to provide the PSU metadata for such operations.\n<br/><br/>\nAs finAPI does not have direct interaction with the end-user,\nit is the client application's responsibility to provide all the necessary\ninformation about the end-user. This must be done by sending additional headers with every request\ntriggered on behalf of the end-user.\n<br/><br/>\nAt the moment, the following headers are supported by the API:<br/>\n&bull; \"PSU-IP-Address\" - the IP address of the user's device.<br/>\n&bull; \"PSU-Device-OS\" - the user's device and/or operating system identification.<br/>\n&bull; \"PSU-User-Agent\" - the user's web browser or other client device identification.\n\n<h3 id=\"general-faq\"><strong>FAQ</strong></h3>\n<strong>Is there a finAPI SDK?</strong>\n<br/>\nCurrently we do not offer a native SDK, but there is the option to generate an SDK\nfor almost any target language via OpenAPI. Use the 'Download SDK' button on this page for SDK\ngeneration.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>How can I enable finAPI's automatic batch update?</strong>\n<br/>\nCurrently there is no way to set up the batch update via the API.\nPlease contact support@finapi.io for this.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Why do I need to keep authorizing when calling services on this page?</strong>\n<br/>\nThis page is a \"one-page-app\". Reloading the page resets the OAuth authorization context.\nThere is generally no need to reload the page, so just don't do it and your authorization will persist.\n",

        "description": "finAPI implements the OAuth 2.0 Standard for authorizing applications and users within applications. OAuth uses the terminology of clients and users. A client represents an application that calls finAPI services. A service call might be in the context of a user of the client (e.g.: getting a user's bank connections), or outside any user context (e.g.: editing your client's configuration, or creating a new user for your client). In any case, every service call must be authorized by an access_token. This service can be used to get such an access_token, for either one of the client's users, or for the client itself. Also, this service can be used to refresh the access_token of a user that has previously requested an access_token.<br/><br/>To get a token, you must always pass a valid client identifier and client secret (=client credentials). You can get free client credentials for the sandbox <a href='http://www.finapi.io/jetzt-testen/' target='_blank'>here</a>. Alternatively, you can also contact us at <a href='mailto:support@finapi.io'>support@finapi.io</a>.<br/><br/>The authorization process is similar for both a user within a client, and for the client itself: <br/>&bull; To authorize a client (i.e. application), use <code>grant_type=client_credentials</code><br/>&bull; To authorize a user, use <code>grant_type=password</code><br/><br/>If the given parameters are valid, the service will respond with the authorization data. <br/>Here is an example of a response when authorizing a user: <br/><pre>{\n   \"access_token\": \"yvMbx_TgwdYE0hgOVb8N4ZOvxOukqfjzYOGRZcJiCjQuRGkVIBfjjV3YG4zKTGiY2aPn2cQTGaQOT8uo5uo7_QOXts1s5UBSVuRHc6a8X30RrGBTyqV9h26SUHcZPNbZ\",\n   \"token_type\": \"bearer\",\n   \"refresh_token\": \"0b9KjiBVlZLz7a4HshSAIcFuscStiXT1VzT5mgNYwCQ_dWctTDsaIjedAhD1LpsOFJ7x6K8Emf8M3VOQkwNFR9FHijALYSQw2UeRwAC2MvrOKwfF1dHmOq5VEVYEaGf6\",\n   \"expires_in\": 3600,\n   \"scope\": \"all\"\n}</pre><br/><p>Use the returned access_token for other service calls by sending it in a 'Authorization' header, with the word 'Bearer' in front of the token. Like this:</p><pre>Authorization: Bearer yvMbx_TgwdYE0hgOVb8N4ZOvxOukqfjzYOGRZcJiCjQuRGkVIBfjjV3YG4zKTGiY2aPn2cQTGaQOT8uo5uo7_QOXts1s5UBSVuRHc6a8X30RrGBTyqV9h26SUHcZPNbZ</pre><p><b>WARNING</b>: Sending the access_token as a request parameter is deprecated and will probably be no longer supported in the next release of finAPI. Please always send the access_token in the request header, as shown above.</p><p>By default, the access tokens have an expiration time of one hour (however, you can change this via the service PATCH /clientConfiguration). If a token has expired, then using the token for a service call will result in a HTTP code 401. To restore access you can simply get a new token (as it is described above) or use <code>grant_type=refresh_token</code> (which works for user-related tokens only). In the latter case you just have to pass the previously received <code>refresh_token</code> for the user.</p><p>If explicit user verification is required (the 'isUserAutoVerificationEnabled' flag in the client configuration is set to false, see Client Configuration) and the user that you want to authorize is not yet verified by the client (see Verify a User), then the service will respond with HTTP code 403. If the user is locked (see 'maxUserLoginAttempts' in the Client Configuration), the service will respond with HTTP code 423.</p><p>If the current role has no privileges to call a certain service (e.g. if a user tries to create a new user, or if a client tries to access user data outside of any user context), then the request will fail with the HTTP code 403.</p><p><b>IMPORTANT NOTES:</b><br/>&bull; Even though finAPI is not logging query parameters, it is still recommended to pass the parameters in the POST body instead of in the URL. Also, please set the Content-Type of your request to 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' when calling this service.<br/>&bull; You should use this service only when you actually need a new token. As long as a token exists and has not expired, the service will always return the same token for the same credentials. Calling this service repeatedly with the same credentials contradicts the idea behind the tokens in OAuth, and will have a negative impact on the performance of your application. So instead of retrieving the same tokens over and over with this service, you should cache the tokens and re-use them as long as they have not expired - or at least as long as you're using the same tokens repeatedly, e.g. for the time of an active user session in your application.</p>",

        "description": "This service can be used to mock an update of one or several bank connections by letting you simulate finAPI's communication with a bank server. More specifically, you can provide custom balances and transactions for existing accounts and finAPI will import that data into the accounts as if the data had been delivered by a real bank server during a real update. The idea of this service is to allow you to create accounts with specific data in them so that you can test your application in different scenarios.<br/><br/>You can also test your application's reception and processing of push notifications with this service, by enabling the 'triggerNotifications' flag in your request. When this flag is enabled, finAPI will send notifications to your application based on the notification rules that are set up for the user and on the data you provided in the request, the same way as it works with finAPI's real automatic batch update process.<br/><br/>Note that this service behaves mostly like calling the bank connection update service, meaning that it returns immediately after having asynchronously started the update process, and also meaning that you have to check the status of the updated bank connections and accounts to find out when the update has finished and what the result is. As you can update several bank connections at once, this service is closer to how finAPI's automatic batch updates work as it is to the manual update service though. Because of this, the result of the mocked bank connection updates will be stored in the 'lastAutoUpdate' field of the bank connection interface and not in the 'lastManualUpdate' field. Also, just like with the real batch update, any bank connection that you use with this service must have a PIN stored (even though it is not actually forwarded to any bank server).<br/><br/>Also note that this service may be called only when the user's automatic bank connection updates are disabled, to make sure that the mock updates cannot intervene with a real update (please see the User field 'isAutoUpdateEnabled'). Also, it is currently not possible to mock data for security accounts with this service, as you can only pass transactions, but not security positions.<br/><br/>Please be aware that you will 'mess up' the accounts when using this service, meaning that when you perform a real update of accounts that you have previously updated with this service, finAPI might detect inconsistencies in the data that exists in its database and the data that is reported by the bank server, and try to fix this with the insertion of an adjusting entry ('Zwischensaldo' transaction). Also, new real transactions might not get imported as finAPI could match them to mocked transactions. Also note that transactions older than 89 days from the current date will be skipped. <b>THIS SERVICE IS MEANT FOR TESTING PURPOSES DURING DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR APPLICATION ONLY!</b> This is why it will work only on the sandbox or alpha environments. Calling it on the live environment will result in <b>403 Forbidden</b>.",

It is not guaranteed though that this candidate will actually be applied, as there could be other categorization rules that have higher priority or that are an even better match for the transaction. If there are multiple keyword rules that match a transaction, finAPI will pick the one with the highest count of matched keywords.<br/><br/>Note that the rules that you define here will be applied to all of your users. They have higher priority than finAPI's default categorization rules, but lower priority than user-specific rules (User-specific rules are created implicitly whenever a category is manually assigned to a transaction via the PATCH /transactions services). Keyword rules have a lower priority than IBAN rules (see the 'Create IBAN rules' service).",

It is not guaranteed though that this candidate will actually be applied, as there could be other categorization rules that have higher priority or that are an even better match for the transaction.<br/><br/>Note that the rules that you define here will be applied to all of your users. They have higher priority than finAPI's default categorization rules, but lower priority than user-specific rules (User-specific rules are created implicitly whenever a category is manually assigned to a transaction via the PATCH /transactions services). IBAN rules have a higher priority than keyword rules (see the 'Create keyword rules' service).",

Must pass the new label's name and the user's access_token.<br/><br/>Users can create labels to flag transactions (see method PATCH /transactions), with the goal of collecting and getting an overview of all transactions of a certain 'type'. In this sense, labels are similar to transaction categories. However, labels are supposed to depict more of an implicit meaning of a transaction. For instance, a user might want to assign a flag to a transaction that reminds him that he can offset it against tax. At the same time, the category of the transactions might be something like 'insurance', which is a more 'fact-based', or 'objective' way of typing the transaction. Despite this semantic difference between categories and labels, there is also the difference that a transaction can be assigned multiple labels at the same time (while in contrast it can have just a single category).",

Downloads and imports the current account balances and new transactions. Note that if the bank connection has several interfaces and some of its accounts was previously imported or updated via an interface which have higher priority than the interface used in the current update, then balances and transactions will not be downloaded for such accounts (The XS2A interface has the highest priority, followed by FINTS_SERVER and finally WEB_SCRAPER). Must pass the connection's identifier and the user's access_token. For more information about the processes of authentication, data download and transaction categorization, see POST /bankConnections/import. Note that supported two-step-procedures are updated as well. It may unset the current default two-step-procedure of the given bank connection (but only if this procedure is not supported anymore by the bank). You can also update the \"demo connection\" (in this case, secret login credentials and the fields 'importNewAccounts' and 'skipPositionsDownload' will be ignored).<br/><br/>Note that you cannot trigger an update of a bank connection as long as there is still a previously triggered update running.<br/><br/>For a more in-depth understanding of the update process, please also read this page on our Access Public Documentation: <a href='https://documentation.finapi.io/access/Post-Processing-of-Bank-Account-Import%2FUpdate.2766405656.html' target='_blank'>Post Processing of Bank Account Import/Update</a><br/><br/>NOTE (THIS LOGIC IS DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED):<br/>Depending on your license, this service may respond with HTTP code 451, containing an error message with an identifier of Web Form in it.

Be aware that certain services (like GET /accounts/dailyBalances) may give incorrect results for accounts in such a state.<br/>&bull; If this bank connection is updated via finAPI's automatic batch update, then transactions and security positions (of already imported accounts) <u>will</u> be downloaded in any case!<br/>&bull; For security accounts, skipping the downloading of the securities might result in the account's balance also not being downloaded.<br/>&bull; For Bausparen accounts, this field is ignored. finAPI will always download transactions for Bausparen accounts.<br/>",

NOTE: In some cases, banks may deliver transactions that are booked in future, but already included in the current account balance. To keep the account balance consistent with the set of transactions, such \"future transactions\" will be imported with their finapiBookingDate set to the current date (i.e.: date of import). The finapiBookingDate will automatically get adjusted towards the bankBookingDate each time the associated bank account is updated. Example: A transaction is imported on July, 3rd, with a bank reported booking date of July, 6th. The transaction will be imported with its finapiBookingDate set to July, 3rd. Then, on July 4th, the associated account is updated. During this update, the transaction's finapiBookingDate will be automatically adjusted to July 4th. This adjustment of the finapiBookingDate takes place on each update until the bank account is updated on July 6th or later, in which case the transaction's finapiBookingDate will be adjusted to its final value, July 6th.<br/> The finapiBookingDate is the date that is used by the finAPI PFM services. E.g. when you calculate the spendings of an account for the current month, and have a transaction with finapiBookingDate in the current month but bankBookingDate at the beginning of the next month, then this transaction is included in the calculations (as the bank has this transaction's amount included in the current account balance as well).",
